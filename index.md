## About

I am a postdoc at Michigan State University in Lansing, MI. I work in the Lowry lab studying the genetic basis of biofuel switchgrass interactions with leaf fungi, and the evolution of weediness in relatives of the drought-tolerant grain crop proso millet.

I am a plant evolutionary ecologist interested in how genetic variation can determine how constrained populations are to particular environments. I study both locally adapted plants and invasive ones, using population and quantitative genetic approaches to determine the contribution of genetic variation to success across habitats. My research has explored the roles of both abiotic factors such as climate and biotic factors such as the fungal microbiome interacting with genetic diversity to control species ranges.

## Research

My goal as a researcher is to understand how organisms adapt to novel and rapidly changing environments. In particular, I study invasive and locally adapted plants as model systems to learn about the genetics underlying traits that aid adaptation to stressful biotic and abiotic conditions. My recent research has examined host-microbe interactions in the plant leaf, the genomic basis of local adaptation to fungal pathogens, and stress tolerance in weedy relatives of domesticated species. My research has taken me in numerous directions in ecology, genetics, evolution, and microbiology, and I look forward to all of the places it will take me in the future.

## Teaching

One of the most amazing attributes of that natural world is that it becomes endlessly more fascinating the more you know about it. My goal as a biology teacher is to inspire this fascination in my students and to give them the tools they need to ask new questions about biological phenomena. I accomplish this goal by first building studentsâ€™ interest and knowledge through detailed natural examples. I then allow students to pursue topics of their interest in inquiry-based projects.

My teaching philosophy rests on the idea that, as long as they have been provided with the appropriate tools and inspiration, students learn best when they are free to choose topics that interest them. I have applied this philosophy in several classes over my career, with some truly outstanding results. Below are some educational materials I have designed, and some outcomes of exercises from my students.

 Ensure Correct Header IDs:
        Double-check that the href values of your buttons match the IDs of the corresponding headers. For example, if you have a button with href="#About", there should be a header with id="About".

   Check for Typos:
        Verify that there are no typos or case sensitivity issues in the header IDs and button href values. They must match exactly.

   Verify Proper Markdown Header Syntax:
        Ensure that your Markdown headers are written with the correct syntax. For example, ## About, ## Teaching, and ## Research.

   Check for Other JavaScript or CSS Conflicts:
        If you have custom JavaScript or CSS in your project, there might be conflicts. Try temporarily disabling other scripts or styles to see if the issue persists.

   Use Full URLs for Local Anchors (Optional):
        While not always necessary, you can try using full URLs for local anchors. For example, href="#About" could be written as href="http://yoursite.com#About".

   Ensure Content is Loaded:
        Ensure that the content corresponding to the headers is loaded and available on the page. If the content is dynamically loaded, make sure it's loaded before attempting to scroll.

   Test in Different Browsers:
        Test the behavior in different web browsers to see if the issue is browser-specific.

   Check Browser Console for Errors:
        Open the browser console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" then going to the "Console" tab) and check for any errors related to JavaScript or anchor scrolling.
