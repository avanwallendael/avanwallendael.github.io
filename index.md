## About

I am a postdoc at Michigan State University in Lansing, MI. I work in the [Lowry lab]( studying the genetic basis of biofuel switchgrass interactions with leaf fungi, and the evolution of weediness in relatives of the drought-tolerant grain crop proso millet.

I am a plant evolutionary ecologist interested in how genetic variation can determine how constrained populations are to particular environments. I study both locally adapted plants and invasive ones, using population and quantitative genetic approaches to determine the contribution of genetic variation to success across habitats. My research has explored the roles of both abiotic factors such as climate and biotic factors such as the fungal microbiome interacting with genetic diversity to control species ranges.

## Research

My goal as a researcher is to understand how organisms adapt to novel and rapidly changing environments. In particular, I study invasive and locally adapted plants as model systems to learn about the genetics underlying traits that aid adaptation to stressful biotic and abiotic conditions. My recent research has examined host-microbe interactions in the plant leaf, the genomic basis of local adaptation to fungal pathogens, and stress tolerance in weedy relatives of domesticated species. My research has taken me in numerous directions in ecology, genetics, evolution, and microbiology, and I look forward to all of the places it will take me in the future.
